# apt-cli-RE-claude-code

APT (formerly Erosolar) now ships as `apt` with config/state under `~/.apt` (legacy `~/.erosolar` is still honored). The CLI also includes a penetration-testing suite (nmap/nuclei/ffuf/gobuster) for defensive baselines and red-team recon—enable the `Penetration testing` tool option via `/tools` to use it.

This RE, after manually implementation the correct strategy, is incredibly boring because 100% of edits work properly afterwards, achieving full Claude Code parity in a modular way with minimal human intervention needed.

# Ghidra automation bridge

The CLI can now drive headless Ghidra (import, auto-analysis, and scripted post-processing) directly from the agent. See `docs/ghidra-automation.md` for setup, inline script examples, and tips for vuln/offensive workflows.

# For agentic orchestration offense beats defense entirely so this is entirely hilarious for me; I’m open sourcing this version but using genai to generate agents to run for any task as the product

I was well aware of what the APT kill chain was before reading this https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage and afterwards I had to open source the thing I wanted to offer as schema so any LLM could generate a template then run any AGI task, provided you connected the accounts you need, in minutes https://ero.solar

At this point, it's actually incredibly boring to manage, and could 100% easily, so easily, be done fully autonomously with AI.

So boring...

# already on backend hooks; nasty; finish soon! like 2 hours full auto no human required?

So you run "implement as much more advanced or optimal features or design found in claud-code into Erosolar CLI" whatever times let's say 5 auto accepting every premission request, then you run an npm i -g . and see if there's any lint errors. If so fix then back to the 5x loop, or if not run the 5x loop, until finished!

My advice for let's say Israel and Iran, is to not launch even if lauching kill takes no skill, cuz I know for example Iran's defenses are basically non existent; so..

Obtaining DoJ guidance on testing this on North Korea means nothing cuz look at what happened to Comey; it's purely a polutucal payback weaponized attack and nothing else...

predict next statistical token; so "remove all non essential code routes such as skill from app, then remove source code, baking in final schema"
